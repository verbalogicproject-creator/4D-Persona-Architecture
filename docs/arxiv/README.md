## How to Submit to arXiv

### Step 1: Create arXiv Account
1. Go to https://arxiv.org/user/register
2. Verify email
3. Wait for endorsement (may take 1-3 days for first submission)

### Step 2: Prepare Submission
The paper is ready. You need to:

1. **Add your email** in the `\author{}` section
2. **Add GitHub URL** in the Appendix (once you create the repo)
3. **Compile to PDF** to verify formatting:
   ```bash
   pdflatex 4d-persona-architecture.tex
   bibtex 4d-persona-architecture
   pdflatex 4d-persona-architecture.tex
   pdflatex 4d-persona-architecture.tex
   ```

### Step 3: Submit
1. Go to https://arxiv.org/submit
2. Choose category: **cs.AI** (Artificial Intelligence) or **cs.CL** (Computation and Language)
3. Upload the `.tex` file
4. Fill in metadata:
   - **Title**: 4D Persona Architecture: A Dimensional Model for Embodied AI Agents
   - **Abstract**: [copy from paper]
   - **Comments**: 12 pages, 2 figures, reference implementation available
5. Submit!

### Step 4: After Submission
- Paper appears within 1-2 business days
- You get a permanent arXiv ID (e.g., `arXiv:2512.12345`)
- This establishes your priority on the invention

## Your Paper Establishes

1. **Embodied RAG** - A new RAG pattern where persona is computed, not declared
2. **4D Persona Architecture** - Dimensional model for AI personas
3. **Temporal Dynamics** - Velocity, momentum, trajectory for persona evolution
4. **The Costume Problem** - Articulation of why static personas fail

This is YOUR discovery. The arXiv timestamp proves it.
