"""
Poisson Goal Predictor: The Third Lens
======================================

Instead of predicting winner directly, this model:
1. Predicts expected goals (xG) for each team
2. Uses Poisson distribution to calculate scoreline probabilities
3. Derives win/draw/loss from goal probabilities

Mathematical Foundation:
- P(X goals) = (λ^X × e^-λ) / X!
- P(scoreline h-a) = P(home=h) × P(away=a)
- P(Home Win) = Σ P(h > a for all h,a)
- P(Draw) = Σ P(h = a for all h,a)
- P(Away Win) = Σ P(a > h for all h,a)

This approach captures the inherent randomness of football through
the Poisson distribution, which naturally produces draw probabilities.
