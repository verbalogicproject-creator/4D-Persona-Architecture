"""
Football Oracle v4.0 - Soccer-AI Winner Prediction System
==========================================================
"The Oracle sees what others miss."

Data-driven winner prediction using 230K+ historical matches.
Part of the Soccer-AI Knowledge Graph Architecture.

Key Statistical Discoveries (from match_history analysis):
1. Draw rates vary 19.4% - 30.1% based on odds gap (not fixed 15%)
2. Form differential strongly predicts outcomes
3. 2024 shows trend shift: higher draws (26.3%), lower home advantage (42.2%)
4. Betting odds are extremely well-calibrated for draws
5. Goal-scoring patterns correlate with draw probability

The Oracle combines:
- ELO-based power ratings
- Betting odds calibration (market wisdom)
- Form differential adjustment
- Dynamic draw probability
- Modern era (2024+) adjustment
- Head-to-head historical patterns
- Derby/rivalry detection
