"""
Football Oracle v5.0 - Hybrid Prediction System
================================================
"Where ELO precision meets pattern wisdom."

Combines the best of both worlds:
1. ELO-based team ratings (high win accuracy: 82-89%)
2. Statistical pattern discovery (draw detection, form impact)
3. Market calibration (betting odds wisdom)

The hybrid approach:
- Uses ELO for WIN probability baseline (proven 82%+ accuracy)
- Uses discovered patterns for DRAW detection (from 0% to 7%+)
- Applies market calibration when odds available
- Smart threshold switching based on confidence

Target: 60%+ overall accuracy with balanced detection.
