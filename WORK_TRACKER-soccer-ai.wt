# Work Tracker: Soccer-AI MVP

**Project**: Soccer-AI - Living Knowledge Base with AI Chat
**Type**: Full-Stack Application (Portfolio + Real Product)
**Status**: Architecture Design Phase
**Started**: December 18, 2024
**Location**: synthesis-rules/soccer-AI/

## Project Overview

A soccer knowledge base with:
- Structured database of players, teams, games, stats
- RAG-powered retrieval for relevant context
- Haiku API for natural language responses
- React chatbot frontend
- Automated daily updates

---

## Phase Tracking

| Phase | Status | Est. Time | Notes |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------|
| 1. Architecture Design | IN PROGRESS | 1 day | Schema, API, decisions |
| 2. Database Setup | PENDING | 1-2 days | SQLite or Supabase |
| 3. Backend API | PENDING | 2-3 days | FastAPI + RAG |
| 4. AI Integration | PENDING | 1-2 days | Haiku response gen |
| 5. Frontend Chat | PENDING | 3-5 days | React + TypeScript |
| 6. Automation | PENDING | 1-2 days | Daily updates |
| 7. Polish & Deploy | PENDING | 2-3 days | Vercel deployment |

**Total Estimated**: 2-3 weeks

## Architecture Decisions

### Database Choice
- [ ] SQLite + FTS5 (simple, local, free)
- [ ] Supabase (hosted, auth, realtime, free tier)

### Backend Stack
- [ ] FastAPI (Python) - proven pattern
- [ ] Node.js/Express - same language as frontend

### AI Integration
- [x] Haiku API for response generation
- [ ] RAG retrieval strategy

### Frontend Stack
- [x] React + TypeScript
- [x] Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Component library choice

## Current Session Goals

### Session 1 (Dec 18 Evening)
- [x] Create work tracker
- [ ] Finalize architecture decisions
- [ ] Create project structure
- [ ] Design database schema
- [ ] Begin implementation

## Key Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Reasoning |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Dec 18 | Conventional KB + RAG over Agent Swarm | Simpler, same result, easier debug |
| Dec 18 | Haiku for responses | Cost-effective (~$0.001/query) |
| Dec 18 | Soccer-AI as name | Clear, memorable |
